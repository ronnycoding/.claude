# Secure Web Search Guide

This skill helps you perform secure web searches while protecting privacy, verifying sources, and validating information accuracy. Essential for research, fact-checking, and gathering reliable information.

## Quick Start

When performing secure web searches, follow this workflow:

1. **Define search intent** - What information do you need and why?
2. **Choose search method** - Direct search, privacy-focused engine, or specialized tools
3. **Craft effective query** - Use search operators and specific terms
4. **Verify sources** - Check credibility, authority, and bias
5. **Validate information** - Cross-reference multiple sources
6. **Protect privacy** - Avoid tracking, use secure connections
7. **Document findings** - Track sources and evidence
8. **Assess reliability** - Determine confidence level in results
